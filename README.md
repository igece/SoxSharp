## SoxSharp

SoxSharp is a C# library that serves as a wrapper to [SoX - the Sound eXchange tool](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).
SoX is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command line utility that can convert various formats of computer audio files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these sound files and play and record audio files on most platforms.


### How It Works

#### Initial Setup

When instantiating the **Sox** class, we pass to the constructor the location of the SoX executable to be used. Please note that, when SoX is executed, the directory of the application using the library will be used as the working directory, so any relative path included in both input and output files shall be relative to this directory.


#### Get File Information

Usage is pretty straightforward:

```cs
using (Sox sox = new Sox("sox.exe"))
{
  AudioInfo wavInfo = sox.GetInfo("test.wav");
  Console.WriteLine(wavInfo);
}
```

This is the same as executing `sox --info test.wav`. SoxSharp parses the SoX output and fills an **AudioInfo** instance with the retrieved information.


#### File Conversion

The simplest way to perform an audio conversion is to just call the **Sox.Process** method with both input and output files:

```cs
using (Sox sox = new Sox("sox.exe"))
{
  sox.Process("test.wav", "test.mp3");
}
```

The previous code will launch SoX with 'test.wav' as input file and 'test.mp3' as output file (the equivalent of executing SoX with the following parameters: `sox test.wav test.mp3`). 

To force the output to be encoded with MP3 format (instead of letting SoX to guess it from the output file extension) and use a sample rate of 32 KHz:

```cs
using (Sox sox = new Sox("sox.exe"))
{
  sox.Output.Type = FileType.MP3;
  sox.Output.SampleRate = 32000;

  sox.Process("test.wav", "test.mp3");
}
```

This is equivalent to call SoX with the following parameters: `sox test.wav --type mp3 --rate 32000 test.mp3`.

SoX global options can be set through their respective properties in the **Sox** class. Format options to be applied to the output can be stablished through its respective properties in **Sox.Output**.

Format options to be applied to the input are specified passing an **InputFile** instance to the **Sox.Process** method (instead of an input file string):

```cs
using (Sox sox = new Sox("sox.exe"))
{
  sox.Output.Type = FileType.MP3;
  sox.Output.SampleRate = 32000;

  InputFile testInput = new InputFile("test.wav");
  testInput.Volume = 0.8;

  sox.Process(testInput, "test.mp3");
}
```

This is equivalent to call SoX with the following parameters: `sox --volume 0.8 test.wav --type mp3 --rate 32000 test.mp3`.


#### Applying Effects

One or multiple effects can be added so they will applied to the output file:

```cs
using (Sox sox = new Sox("sox.exe"))
{
  sox.Output.Type = FileType.MP3;
  sox.Effects.Add(new VolumeEffect(10, GainType.Db));
  sox.Effects.Add(new HighPassFilterEffect(500));

  sox.Process("test.wav", "test.mp3");
}
```

Currently not all SoX effects have been implemented into SoxSharp. To see which effects are supported, please read [this issue](https://github.com/igece/SoxSharp/issues/1).


#### Playing and Recording

To record audio from the default audio device, use the **Sox.Record** method specifying the output file name:

```cs
sox.Record("test_record.mp3");
```

Analogously, **Sox.Play** allows to send an input file to the default audio device. In this case, the input file can be expressed as an file name string or a **InputFile** instance.

The same results can be obtained if calling **Sox.Process** using `--default-device` as output (for playing) or input (for recording) file.


#### Error Handling

If any requested SoX operation is unable to be processed, either because SoX process can't be launched or beacuse it generates an error, a **SoxException** with details about the error will be thrown.


#### Events

You can subscribe to receive any log message generated by SoX through the **OnLogMessage** event. Please note that log messages of type FAIL will not be reported through this event but as exceptions, as stated in [Error Handling](#error-handling).

```cs
// Subscribe to OnLogMessage.
sox.OnLogMessage += sox_OnLogMessage;

void sox_OnLogMessage(object sender, LogMessageEventArgs e)
{
  Console.WriteLine(e.LogLevel + ": " + e.Message);
}
```

Also, while executing a **Process** call you can obtain updated progress information about the operation subscribing to the **OnProgress** event:

```cs
// Subscribe to OnProgress event before calling Process method.
sox.OnProgress += sox_OnProgress;

void sox_OnProgress(object sender, ProgressEventArgs e)
{
  Console.WriteLine("{0} ({1}% completed)", e.Processed.ToString(@"hh\:mm\:ss\.ff"), e.Progress);
}
```


### Concurrency

All the work is done in the calling thread. Each **Sox** class instance can handle only one process at the same time, and will block the calling thread until finished. You are responsible for creating any worker thread if needed. 

The library provides two different methods to cancel any work that is in progress:

* Calling the **Abort()** method of the **Sox** class. 

* Inside the **OnProgress** event handler. **ProgressEventArgs** provides a boolean **Abort** member that can be set to **true** to end the current work.
